
# ðŸ”— Youtube Channel Analysis

Hey, so this code is all about analyzing the top subscribed Youtube channels dataset, which has information about the most subscribed Youtube channels in the world. This dataset is used to gain insights into the characteristics of the channels and their categories.

To do this, the code first imports some necessary libraries such as pandas, numpy, and visualization libraries like seaborn, plotly, and matplotlib. Then it reads the dataset from a CSV file and shows the first five rows of the dataset.

After that, the code removes unnecessary columns and checks for missing values. It also checks the unique values of the Category column and removes rows with an unknown category. The final dataset is then described, showing various statistical information.

Next, the code creates two plots to visualize the data. The first plot shows the percentage of Youtube channels by category using a pie chart, where Entertainment, Music, and People & Blogs are the top three categories. The second plot displays a scatter plot of the video views and subscribers by categories using Plotly Express, where Musics, Education, and Shows are the top three categories with the most subscribers and video views.

The code also analyzes the top 10 music channels with the most video count and the top 10 education channels with the most video views. The results are displayed using a bar chart using the seaborn library.

Overall, the code provides insights into the characteristics of the top subscribed Youtube channels, their categories, and their video count and views. It also shows how to perform data processing and visualization using pandas, numpy, seaborn, and plotly libraries.
